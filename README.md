📊 Credit Card Dashboard – Power BI Project

🚀 Project Overview

  This project presents a comprehensive dashboard built in Power BI to analyze customer profiles, credit card usage behavior, and performance metrics. It combines demographic data with transaction and activation patterns to uncover actionable insights for customer acquisition, retention, and risk management.

📂 Datasets Used
* customer.csv - Primary customer demographic data  
* cust_add.csv - Additional customer profiles  
* credit_card.csv - Weekly credit card usage data  
* cc_add.csv - Additional credit card activity  

🧠 Key Insights
📌 Customer Demographics
* Majority of credit card users are aged 30-50 years, with a skew towards urban educated males.

* Most customers are graduates or uneducated, indicating a need to diversify targeting.

* Married customers with dependents and higher incomes tend to have better satisfaction scores.

💳 Card Behavior
* Most popular card type is Blue, but it doesn't always lead to high engagement.

* Customers with low acquisition cost and high credit limits tend to show better transaction volumes.

* Utilization Ratio is directly correlated with interest earned—a key metric for profitability.

⚠️ Risk & Delinquency
* Customers with high utilization (>70%) and low satisfaction are more likely to have delinquent accounts.

* Non-chip and swipe users show higher tendencies towards risky behavior.

* House ownership and income level are predictors of credit limit usage and repayment ability.

💸 Revenue Analysis
* Interest Earned peaks in Q1 and Q4, possibly due to promotions and year-end spending.

* Higher annual fees do not always translate to better transaction volumes — indicating need for fee restructuring.
